# user-management
A quick implementation of a simple REST API that manages user.

The approach I took to write this was TDD. I find this works well with getting tings running quickly.
The API is deployed in Spring Boot and expects a Java 17 target.
This is the culmination of about 4 hours of work. On retrospect I should have pushed updates as I completed tests. :)
